Instructions:

ADD-ON VERSION:

1. Place the "a359" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\
2. With OpenIV, open [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and add this with Notepad++
		<Item>dlcpacks:\a359\</Item>

3. Now you are done, you will need a trainer with "spawn by name" function (Enhanced Native Trainer for example) to spawn the vehicle type in:

"a350"


If the game crashes on startup, use a custom gameconfig.xml (you can find them at gta5-mods.com)


I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
